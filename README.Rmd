## Housing Data

From a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) housing data has been made availible for use with machine learning algorithms. The goal of the competition is to predict the sale price of a home when given 79 explanatory variables.

In `RegressionHousePrices.md` we walk through a quick comparison between linear, stepwise, and penalized regression models on the housing dataset. 

`RegressionHousePrices.Rmd` contains the source code. Likewise, the data used can be found in the csv files `test.csv` and `train.csv`.

`HousePriceEDA.R` contains code that has been used for basic exploration of the dataset for a past project.
